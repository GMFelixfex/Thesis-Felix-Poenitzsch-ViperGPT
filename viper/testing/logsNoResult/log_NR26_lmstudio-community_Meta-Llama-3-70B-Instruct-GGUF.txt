Image: C:/Users/Felix/viper/testing/images/1_kids_muffins.jpg
Query: How many muffins can each kid have for it to be fair?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    kids_patches = image_patch.find("kid")
    muffins_patches = image_patch.find("muffin")

    # Count the number of kids and muffins
    num_kids = len(kids_patches)
    num_muffins = len(muffins_patches)

    # Calculate the fair distribution of muffins per kid
    muffins_per_kid = num_muffins // num_kids

    return f"Each kid can have {muffins_per_kid} muffin(s) for it to be fair."
```
This function first finds all instances of "kid" and "muffin" in the image using the `find` method. It then counts the number of kids and muffins found. Finally, it calculates the fair distribution of muffins per kid by dividing the total number of muffins by the number of kids, and returns a string with the result.

Note that this function assumes that the image contains instances of "kid" and "muffin" that can be detected using the `find` method. If the image does not contain these objects, the function will return an incorrect result. Additionally, this function does not use the `llm_query` function to access external information, as it is not necessary for this specific query.

Image: C:/Users/Felix/viper/testing/images/drinks.jpg
Query: Return the image patches and names of drinks without alcohol.


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> List[Tuple[ImagePatch, str]]:
    """
    Returns a list of tuples containing ImagePatches and their corresponding drink names without alcohol.
    """
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    drink_patches = image_patch.find("drink")
    
    non_alcoholic_drinks = []
    for patch in drink_patches:
        drink_name = patch.simple_query("What is the name of this drink?")
        if not patch.llm_query(f"Does {drink_name} contain alcohol?", long_answer=False):
            non_alcoholic_drinks.append((patch, drink_name))
    
    return non_alcoholic_drinks
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. We create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. We find all patches containing drinks using the `find` method.
3. We iterate through each drink patch and query its name using the `simple_query` method.
4. For each drink, we use the `llm_query` method to ask if it contains alcohol. If the answer is no, we add the patch and its name to our result list.
5. Finally, we return the list of tuples containing ImagePatches and their corresponding non-alcoholic drink names.

Note that this function assumes that the `llm_query` method can access external information to determine if a drink contains alcohol or not.

Image: C:/Users/Felix/viper/testing/images/field_trip2.jpg
Query: How many children are in the picture?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    child_patches = image_patch.find("child")
    return str(len(child_patches))
```
This function takes an image as input, creates an ImagePatch object from it, finds all patches that match the object "child", and returns the count of those patches as a string.

Note: This assumes that the `find` method is able to accurately identify children in the image. If this is not the case, additional processing or machine learning models may be needed to improve the accuracy of child detection.

Query: What color is the shirt of the last child?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    child_patches = image_patch.find("child")
    child_patches.sort(key=lambda x: x.horizontal_center, reverse=True)
    last_child_patch = child_patches[0]
    shirt_patches = last_child_patch.find("shirt")
    if len(shirt_patches) > 0:
        shirt_patch = shirt_patches[0]
        return shirt_patch.simple_query("What is the color of this?")
    else:
        return "No shirt found"
```
Here's how the function works:

1. Create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. Find all patches containing a child using the `find` method.
3. Sort the child patches by their horizontal center coordinate in reverse order, so that the last child is first.
4. Take the first patch (i.e., the last child) and find all patches containing a shirt within it.
5. If a shirt patch is found, use the `simple_query` method to ask about its color.
6. Return the answer as a string.

Note that this function assumes that the image contains at least one child with a visible shirt. If no shirt is found, it returns "No shirt found".

        shirt_patch = shirt_patches[0]
        return shirt_patch.simple_query("What is the color of this?")
    else:
        return "No shirt found"
```
Here's how the function works:

1. Create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. Find all patches containing a child using the `find` method.
3. Sort the child patches by their horizontal center coordinate, so that the last child from the left is at the end of the list.
4. Take the last child patch and find all patches containing a shirt within it using the `find` method again.
5. If a shirt patch is found, use the `simple_query` method to ask about its color.
6. Return the answer as a string.

Note that this function assumes that the image contains children and shirts, and that the shirts have a distinct color. If these assumptions are not met, the function may return incorrect or incomplete answers.

Here's how the function works:

1. Create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. Find all patches containing a child using the `find` method.
3. Sort the child patches by their horizontal center to get the first child from the left.
4. Find all patches containing a shirt within the first child patch using the `find` method again.
5. If a shirt patch is found, use the `simple_query` method to ask about its color and return the answer.
6. If no shirt patch is found, return "Unknown".

Note that this function assumes that the image contains children and shirts, and that the `simple_query` method can accurately determine the color of the shirt.

Here's how the function works:

1. Create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. Find all patches containing a child using the `find` method.
3. Sort the child patches by their horizontal center, in reverse order (i.e., right to left).
4. Take the first patch from the right, which corresponds to the first child from the right of the picture.
5. Find all patches containing a shirt within the first child patch using the `find` method again.
6. If a shirt patch is found, use the `simple_query` method to ask about the color of the shirt and return the answer.
7. If no shirt patch is found, return "No shirt found".

Note that this function assumes that the image contains children and shirts, and that the `find` method can accurately identify these objects. Additionally, the `simple_query` method is used to ask about the color of the shirt, which may not always provide an accurate answer depending on the complexity of the question.

Image: C:/Users/Felix/viper/testing/images/multiple_cats.jpg
Query: How many cats are in the image?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    cat_patches = image_patch.find("cat")
    return str(len(cat_patches))
```
This function takes an image as input, creates an ImagePatch object from it, finds all patches containing a "cat" using the `find` method, and returns the count of those patches as a string.

Note that this function assumes that the `find` method is able to accurately identify cat objects in the image. If the accuracy of the object detection is not sufficient, you may need to use additional processing or fine-tune the object detection model used by the `find` method.

Query: How many cats are sitting or lying on the ground?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    cat_patches = image_patch.find("cat")
    
    # Filter out cats that are not sitting or lying on the ground
    sitting_or_lying_cats = []
    for cat_patch in cat_patches:

    # Count the number of cats sitting or lying on the ground
    count = len(sitting_or_lying_cats)
    
    return f"There are {count} cats sitting or lying on the ground."
```
This function uses the `find` method to find all patches containing a cat, and then filters out the ones that are not sitting or lying on the ground using the `verify_property` method. Finally, it returns the count of cats sitting or lying on the ground as a string.

Note that this implementation assumes that the `verify_property` method can accurately determine whether a cat is sitting or lying on the ground based on visual properties. If this is not the case, additional logic may be needed to make this determination.

    cutlery_patches = image_patch.find("cutlery")
    if not cutlery_patches:
        return "No cutlery found in the image."
    cutlery_patch = cutlery_patches[0]
    type_of_cutlery = cutlery_patch.llm_query("What type of cutlery is this?")
    return type_of_cutlery
```
This function first creates an ImagePatch object from the input image. It then uses the `find` method to search for patches containing "cutlery". If no such patches are found, it returns a message indicating that no cutlery was found in the image.

If cutlery is found, it takes the first patch and uses the `llm_query` method to ask an external language model what type of cutlery it is. The response from the language model is then returned as the answer to the query.

    flower_colors = []
    for flower in flower_patches:
        color = flower.simple_query("What is the color of this flower?")
        flower_colors.append(color)
    
    # Combine the colors (assuming additive color model)
    combined_color = "unknown"
    if len(flower_colors) > 0:
        red, green, blue = 0, 0, 0
        for color in flower_colors:
            if color == "red":
                red += 1
            elif color == "green":

        elif red > 0 and blue > 0:
            combined_color = "purple"
        elif green > 0 and blue > 0:
            combined_color = "teal"
        # Add more color combinations as needed
    
    return combined_color
```
This function finds all the flower patches in the image, extracts their colors using the `simple_query` method, and then combines the colors using a simple additive model. The resulting color is returned as a string.

Note that this implementation assumes a basic understanding of color theory and may not work for all possible color combinations. You may need to add more logic or use a more advanced color model to handle edge cases.

        color = flower.simple_query("What is the color of this flower?")
        flower_colors.append(color)
    
    # Mix the colors (assuming it's a simple additive process)
    mixed_color = "unknown"
    if len(flower_colors) > 0:
        if all(c == "red" for c in flower_colors):
            mixed_color = "red"
        elif all(c == "blue" for c in flower_colors):
            mixed_color = "blue"
        else:
            # Use external knowledge to determine the mixed color
            question = f"What color do you get when you mix {', '.join(flower_colors)}?"
            mixed_color = image_patch.llm_query(question, long_answer=False)
    
    return mixed_color
```
This function first finds all the flower patches in the image using the `find` method. Then, it gets the color of each flower using the `simple_query` method. Finally, it mixes the colors by checking if they are all the same (in which case the mixed color is that color) or uses external knowledge via the `llm_query` method to determine the mixed color.

Note that this implementation assumes a simple additive process for mixing colors, and may not work correctly for more complex color mixing scenarios. Additionally, it relies on the `llm_query` method to access external information, which may not always be available or accurate.

    combined_color = image_patch.llm_query(f"What color do you get when you combine {color1} and {color2}?")
    
    return combined_color
```
This function first finds all patches in the image that match the object "flower". It then assumes there are exactly two flowers and extracts their colors using the `simple_query` method. Finally, it uses the `llm_query` method to ask an external language model what color is obtained when combining the two colors, and returns the answer.

    mixed_color = image_patch.llm_query(f"What color do you get when you mix {color1} and {color2}?")
    
    return mixed_color
```
This function first finds all patches in the image that contain flowers. It then extracts the colors of each flower using the `simple_query` method. Finally, it uses the `llm_query` method to ask an external language model what color is produced when the two colors are mixed, and returns the answer.

Image: C:/Users/Felix/viper/testing/images/field_trip.jpg
Query: What is the ratio of teachers to children in the image?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    teacher_patches = image_patch.find("teacher")
    child_patches = image_patch.find("child")

    if not teacher_patches or not child_patches:
        return "Unknown"

    num_teachers = len(teacher_patches)
    num_children = len(child_patches)

    ratio = num_teachers / num_children
    return f"The ratio of teachers to children is {ratio:.2f}"
```
Here's how the function works:

1. Create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. Use the `find` method to find all patches containing "teacher" and "child".
3. If either of these searches returns no results, return "Unknown".
4. Calculate the number of teachers and children by counting the number of patches found.
5. Calculate the ratio of teachers to children by dividing the number of teachers by the number of children.
6. Return a string with the calculated ratio, rounded to two decimal places.

Note that this function assumes that the image contains distinct objects labeled as "teacher" and "child". If the image does not contain these labels, or if the labels are ambiguous, the function may not work correctly. Additionally, this function does not use external information (e.g. via `llm_query`) to answer the question, as it is focused on analyzing the image itself.

    laptop_patches = image_patch.find("laptop")
    if not laptop_patches:
        return "No laptop found"
    laptop_patch = laptop_patches[0]
    sticker_patches = laptop_patch.find("sticker")
    if not sticker_patches:
        return "No stickers found on the laptop"
    sticker_patches.sort(key=lambda x: (x.lower, -x.right))  # sort by lower edge and then right edge
    bottom_right_sticker = sticker_patches[0]
    return bottom_right_sticker.simple_query("What is this sticker?")
```
Here's how the function works:

1. First, it creates an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. It finds all patches containing a laptop in the image using the `find` method.
3. If no laptops are found, it returns an error message.
4. It takes the first laptop patch and finds all sticker patches within it using the `find` method again.
5. If no stickers are found on the laptop, it returns an error message.
6. It sorts the sticker patches by their lower edge (i.e., the y-coordinate of the bottom edge) and then by their right edge (i.e., the x-coordinate of the right edge). This ensures that the sticker in the bottom-right corner is first in the sorted list.
7. Finally, it returns the result of a simple query on the bottom-right sticker patch to determine what type of sticker it is.

Note that this function assumes that there is only one laptop in the image and that the stickers are relatively small compared to the laptop. If these assumptions don't hold, the function may need to be modified accordingly.

    topping_patches = top_right_pizza_patch.find("topping")
    topping_names = [patch.simple_query() for patch in topping_patches]
    return ", ".join(topping_names)
```
Here's how the function works:

1. Create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. Find all patches containing "pizza" and sort them by their horizontal center coordinate in descending order (i.e., rightmost first).
3. Take the top-right pizza patch and find all patches containing "topping" within it.
4. For each topping patch, use the `simple_query` method to get its name.
5. Join the topping names with commas and return the result.

Note that this function assumes that the toppings are labeled as such in the image, and that the `simple_query` method can extract their names. If this is not the case, additional processing may be needed.

Query: How many animals are in the image?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    animal_patches = image_patch.find("animal")
    return str(len(animal_patches))
```
This function takes an image as input, creates an ImagePatch object from it, finds all patches containing animals using the `find` method, and returns the count of those patches as a string.

Note that this function assumes that the `find` method is able to accurately identify animal objects in the image. If the accuracy of the `find` method is not sufficient, additional processing or refinement may be necessary.

Image: C:/Users/Felix/viper/testing/images/different_animals.jpg
Query: How many different animals are in the image?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    animal_patches = image_patch.find("animal")
    unique_animals = set()
    for patch in animal_patches:
        animal_name = patch.simple_query("What is this animal?")
        unique_animals.add(animal_name)
    return f"There are {len(unique_animals)} different animals in the image."
```
Here's how the function works:

1. Create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. Use the `find` method to find all patches that contain an "animal".
3. Initialize an empty set `unique_animals` to store unique animal names.
4. Iterate over each animal patch and use the `simple_query` method to ask "What is this animal?" and get the answer.
5. Add each animal name to the `unique_animals` set, which automatically removes duplicates.
6. Return a string with the count of unique animals in the image.

Note that this function assumes that the ImagePatch class has been implemented correctly and that the `find` and `simple_query` methods work as expected.

Image: C:/Users/Felix/viper/testing/images/competition_building.jpg
Query: Tell me about the competition between the two skyscrapers in the image.


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    skyscraper_patches = image_patch.find("skyscraper")
    
    # Check if there are exactly two skyscrapers
    if len(skyscraper_patches) != 2:
        return "There is no competition between the skyscrapers in the image."
    
    # Sort the skyscrapers by height
    skyscraper_patches.sort(key=lambda x: x.compute_depth(), reverse=True)
    
    # Get the names of the two skyscrapers
    skyscraper1_name = skyscraper_patches[0].simple_query("What is the name of this skyscraper?")
    skyscraper2_name = skyscraper_patches[1].simple_query("What is the name of this skyscraper?")
    
    # Use llm_query to get information about the competition between the two skyscrapers
    competition_info = skyscraper_patches[0].llm_query(f"What is the competition like between {skyscraper1_name} and {skyscraper2_name}?")
    
    return competition_info
```
This function first finds all the skyscrapers in the image, then checks if there are exactly two. If not, it returns a message saying there is no competition. Then, it sorts the skyscrapers by height (using the `compute_depth` method) and gets their names using the `simple_query` method. Finally, it uses the `llm_query` method to get information about the competition between the two skyscrapers and returns the result.

Query: What would the founder of the brand of the car on the left say to the founders of the brand of the other cars?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    car_patches = image_patch.find("car")
    
    # Sort cars by horizontal center (left to right)
    car_patches.sort(key=lambda x: x.horizontal_center)
    
    left_car_patch = car_patches[0]
    other_car_patches = car_patches[1:]
    
    left_car_brand = left_car_patch.simple_query("What is the brand of this car?")
    founders_of_left_car_brand = llm_query(f"Who founded {left_car_brand}?", long_answer=False)
    
    messages = []
    for other_car_patch in other_car_patches:
        other_car_brand = other_car_patch.simple_query("What is the brand of this car?")
        founders_of_other_car_brand = llm_query(f"Who founded {other_car_brand}?", long_answer=False)
        
        message = f"{founders_of_left_car_brand} would say to {founders_of_other_car_brand}:"
        # You can customize the message here based on your requirements
        messages.append(message)
    
    return "\n".join(messages)
```
This function first finds all car patches in the image and sorts them by their horizontal center (left to right). It then identifies the brand of the leftmost car and its founders using the `simple_query` and `llm_query` functions, respectively. Next, it iterates over the remaining car patches, identifying their brands and founders, and constructs a message for each pair of founders. Finally, it returns a string containing all the messages, separated by newline characters.

Note that this implementation assumes that the `llm_query` function can access external information to answer questions about the founders of car brands. You may need to modify the implementation based on your specific requirements and the capabilities of the `llm_query` function.

    speeds = {}
    for animal_patch in animal_patches:
        animal_name = animal_patch.simple_query("What is this animal?")
        speed = coerce_to_numeric(llm_query(f"What is the top speed of a {animal_name}?"))
        speeds[animal_name] = speed
    
    # Find the fastest animal
    fastest_animal = max(speeds, key=speeds.get)
    
    return fastest_animal
```
Here's how the function works:

1. It creates an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. It finds all patches in the image that contain animals using the `find` method.
3. For each animal patch, it uses the `simple_query` method to get the name of the animal.
4. It uses the `llm_query` function to access external knowledge and get the top speed of each animal.
5. It stores the speeds in a dictionary with the animal names as keys.
6. It finds the fastest animal by getting the key with the maximum value from the dictionary using the `max` function with a `key` argument.
7. Finally, it returns the name of the fastest animal.

Note that this function assumes that the `llm_query` function can access external knowledge and provide accurate information about the top speeds of different animals.

        speeds.append((patch, speed))
    
    speeds.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    fastest_patch = speeds[0][0]
    fastest_name = fastest_patch.simple_query("What is the name of this feline?")
    
    return f"The {fastest_name} is the fastest."
```
Here's how the function works:

1. It finds all patches in the image that contain a "feline" object.
2. For each patch, it uses `simple_query` to get the name of the feline, and then uses `llm_query` to access external information about the top speed of that feline breed.
3. It sorts the list of patches by their corresponding speeds in descending order (fastest first).
4. It returns a string indicating which feline is the fastest.

Note that this function assumes that the `llm_query` function can access external information about different feline breeds and their top speeds.

    speeds = []
    for name in animal_names:
        speed_query = f"What is the average running speed of a {name}? "
        speed_answer = image_patch.llm_query(speed_query, long_answer=False)
        speed_value = coerce_to_numeric(speed_answer)
        speeds.append((name, speed_value))
    
    # Sort the animals by their speed and return the fastest one
    speeds.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return f"The fastest Feline animal is a {speeds[0][0]}."
```
This function first finds all the patches containing Feline animals in the image. It then sorts these patches by their horizontal center, assuming that the fastest one is on the right. It gets the names of the three Feline animals and uses the `llm_query` function to get their average running speeds from external sources. Finally, it sorts the animals by their speed and returns the fastest one.

    winter_behavior = toy_patch.llm_query(f"What does a {real_live_version} do in the winter?", long_answer=False)
    return winter_behavior
```
Here's how the function works:

1. First, we create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. We use the `find` method to find all patches in the image that match the object "toy". If no toys are found, we return a message indicating that.
3. We take the first toy patch and use the `llm_query` method to ask what the real live version of this toy is. This will access external information using GPT-3.
4. We then use another `llm_query` to ask what the real live version of the toy does in the winter. We set `long_answer=False` to get a concise answer.
5. Finally, we return the answer to the query.

Note that this function assumes that the image contains a toy, and that the toy has a real-life version that can be looked up using GPT-3. If these assumptions are not met, the function may not work as intended.

Here's how the function works:

1. It creates an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. It finds all patches in the image that match the object "toy animal".
3. If no toy animal is found, it returns a message indicating that.
4. It takes the first toy animal patch and uses its `simple_query` method to ask what the real live version of the toy animal is.
5. It uses the `llm_query` method to ask what the real live version of the toy animal does in the winter, using the answer from step 4 as part of the question.
6. The function returns the answer to the query.

Note that this function assumes that the image contains a toy animal, and that the real live version of the toy animal can be found through external information (using the `llm_query` method).

    sports_query = "What sports are typically played in an {}?".format(arena_patch.simple_query("What is this?"))
    return arena_patch.llm_query(sports_query)
```
Here's how the function works:

1. Create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. Find all patches in the image that match the object "arena".
3. If no arena patches are found, return a message indicating that no arena was found.
4. Take the first arena patch and use its `simple_query` method to determine what type of arena it is (e.g., basketball, hockey, etc.).
5. Use the `llm_ query` method to ask an external language model what sports are typically played in an arena of that type.
6. Return the answer from the language model.

Note that this function assumes that the image contains a clear depiction of an arena, and that the language model can provide accurate information about the types of sports played in such arenas.

    if len(text_patches) == 0:
        return "No text found in the image."
    else:
        return text_patches[0].simple_query()
```
This function first creates an `ImagePatch` object from the input image. Then, it uses the `find` method to search for patches containing text in the image. If no text is found, it returns a message indicating that no text was found. Otherwise, it returns the result of calling the `simple_query` method on the first text patch, which should return the word or phrase contained in the text patch.

Note that this function assumes that the `ImagePatch` class has been implemented correctly and that the `find` and `simple_query` methods work as intended.

    banner_patch = banner_patches[0]
    company_name = banner_patch.llm_query("What company is displayed on this?")
    return company_name
```
This function first finds the advertisement banner in the image using the `find` method of the ImagePatch class. If no banner is found, it returns a message indicating that. Otherwise, it uses the `llm_query` method to ask an external language model what company is displayed on the banner, and returns the answer.

Note that this function assumes that the advertisement banner is a single object in the image, and that the language model can accurately identify the company name from the image. If there are multiple banners or the language model is unsure, additional logic may be needed to handle these cases.

    text_patch = text_patches[0]
    airline_name = text_patch.llm_query("What airline company is this?")
    return airline_name
```
Here's how the function works:

1. Create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. Find all patches that match "advertisement banner" using the `find` method.
3. If no banners are found, return a message indicating that.
4. Take the first banner patch and find all text patches within it using the `find` method again.
5. If no text is found on the banner, return a message indicating that.
6. Take the first text patch and use the `llm_query` method to ask an external language model what airline company is mentioned in the text.
7. Return the answer from the language model.

Note that this function assumes that the advertisement banner contains text that mentions an airline company. If the banner only contains a logo or image, this function may not work as intended.

    airline_name = airline_patch.simple_query("What is the name of the airline?")
    return airline_patch.llm_query(f"What airline company is {airline_name}?")
```
This function first finds all patches in the image that match "banner". Then, it iterates through these patches to find one that is a football advertisement banner. Once found, it searches for an "airline" patch within this banner and extracts its name using the `simple_query` method. Finally, it uses the `llm_ query` method to answer the question about which airline company is displayed on the banner.

Note: This function assumes that the image contains a clear football advertisement banner with an airline company's logo or text. The accuracy of the results depends on the quality of the image and the effectiveness of the ImagePatch class in identifying objects within it.

            airline_name = text
            break
    if not airline_name:
        return "No airline name found on the banner"
    return image_patch.llm_query(f"What global airline company is {airline_name}?", long_answer=False)
```
Here's how the function works:

1. It finds all patches in the image that match the object "advertisement banner".
2. If no such patch is found, it returns an error message.
3. It takes the first patch (assuming there's only one banner) and finds all text patches within it.
4. If no text is found, it returns an error message.
5. It iterates through the text patches and checks if any of them contain the words "airline" or "airlines". If so, it extracts the airline name from that patch.
6. If no airline name is found, it returns an error message.
7. Finally, it uses the `llm_query` function to ask a large language model (e.g., GPT-3) what global airline company matches the extracted airline name. The `long_answer=False` parameter ensures a short answer.

Note that this implementation assumes that the advertisement banner contains text with the airline name, and that the airline name is not too ambiguous or generic. You may need to adjust the logic or add more checks depending on your specific use case.

    for i, obj_patch in enumerate(object_patches):
        for j, other_obj_patch in enumerate(object_patches):
            if i != j and obj_patch.overlaps_with(other_obj_patch.left, other_obj_patch.lower, other_obj_patch.right, other_obj_patch.upper):
                return f"There is a mistake: {obj_patch.simple_query('What is this object?')} is overlapping with {other_obj_patch.simple_query('What is this object?')}"
    
    # Check if any objects are not in their expected location
    for obj_patch in object_patches:
        expected_location = obj_patch.llm_query(f"What is the typical location of a {obj_patch.simple_query('What is this object?')}?", long_answer=False)
        if not obj_patch.simple_query("Is this object in its typical location?"):
            return f"There is a mistake: {obj_patch.simple_query('What is this object?')} is not in its typical location ({expected_location})"
    
    # If no mistakes are found, return "No mistake"
    return "No mistake"
```
This function uses the ImagePatch class to find all objects in the image and then checks for two types of mistakes:

1. Overlapping objects: It checks if any two objects are overlapping by calling the `overlaps_with` method on each object patch.
2. Misplaced objects: It uses the `llm_query` method to ask about the typical location of each object and then checks if the object is in its expected location using the `simple_query` method.

If a mistake is found, the function returns a string describing the mistake. If no mistakes are found, it returns "No mistake".

    longest_book_patch = book_patches[0]
    series_name = longest_book_patch.llm_query("What is the name of this book series?")
    return series_name
```
Here's how the function works:

1. Create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. Find all patches in the image that contain a "book" using the `find` method.
3. Sort the book patches by their width (i.e., length) in descending order using the `sort` method and a lambda function as the key.
4. Take the first patch in the sorted list, which is the longest book patch.
5. Use the `llm_query` method to ask an external language model what the name of the book series is.
6. Return the answer from the language model.

Note that this function assumes that the longest book on the shelf is part of a series, and that the language model can provide the correct answer to the question about the book series.

Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    book_patches = image_patch.find("book")
    
    # Find the shelf patch
    shelf_patches = image_patch.find("shelf")
    if not shelf_patches:
        return "No shelf found"
    shelf_patch = shelf_patches[0]
    
    # Filter books on the shelf
    books_on_shelf = [book for book in book_patches if shelf_patch.overlaps_with(book.left, book.lower, book.right, book.upper)]
    
    # Get the series information for each book using llm_query
    series_info = {}
    for book in books_on_shelf:
        book_name = book.simple_query("What is the name of this book?")
        series_length = int(coerce_to_numeric(book.llm_query(f"How many books are in the {book_name} series?", long_answer=False)))
        series_info[book_name] = series_length
    
    # Find the longest series
    longest_series_book = max(series_info, key=series_info.get)
    
    return f"The book with the longest series is {longest_series_book}"
```
This function first finds all book patches in the image and then filters them to only include books that are on the shelf. It then uses the `llm_query` function to get the series information for each book, and finally finds the book with the longest series using the `max` function with a key function that returns the series length.

Query: What are the students learning in the picture?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    student_patches = image_patch.find("student")
    
    # Find the blackboard or whiteboard patch
    board_patches = image_patch.find("blackboard") + image_patch.find("whiteboard")
    if not board_patches:
        return "Unknown"
    
    # Sort the student patches by distance to the board
    board_patch = board_patches[0]
    student_patches.sort(key=lambda x: distance(x, board_patch))
    
    # Ask the LLM what's on the board
    question = f"What is written on the {board_patch.simple_query('What is this?')}?"
    answer = board_patch.llm_query(question)
    
    return answer
```
This function first finds all the student patches in the image. Then, it finds the blackboard or whiteboard patch (if any). It sorts the student patches by their distance to the board, assuming that the students closest to the board are most likely to be learning from it.

Finally, it asks the LLM what's written on the board using the `llm_query` function and returns the answer.

        question += f"{object_name} "
    
    return image_patch.llm_query(question + "?", long_answer=True)
```
This function first finds all the student patches in the image. Then, it finds objects near each student patch and removes duplicates. It sorts the object patches by size (largest first) and asks an LLM query to determine what the students are learning based on the objects. The LLM query is constructed by listing the objects found near the students.

Query: What common school subject is the student learning in the picture?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    student_patches = image_patch.find("student")
    if not student_patches:
        return "Unknown"
    
    student_patch = student_patches[0]
    desk_patches = image_patch.find("desk")
    if not desk_patches:
        return "Unknown"
    
    desk_patch = desk_patches[0]
    if not student_patch.overlaps_with(desk_patch.left, desk_patch.lower, desk_patch.right, desk_patch.upper):
        return "Unknown"
    
    book_patches = image_patch.find("book")
    if not book_patches:
        return "Unknown"
    
    book_patch = book_patches[0]
    if not book_patch.overlaps_with(desk_patch.left, desk_patch.lower, desk_patch.right, desk_patch.upper):
        return "Unknown"
    
    subject_query = student_patch.llm_query("What is the student learning in this picture?", long_answer=False)
    return subject_query
```
This function first finds the student, desk, and book patches in the image. It then checks if the student and book patches overlap with the desk patch, indicating that the student is likely sitting at a desk with a book. Finally, it uses the `llm_query` method to ask an external language model what subject the student is learning, and returns the answer.

Note that this function assumes that the image contains a student, desk, and book, and that the student is sitting at the desk with the book. If these assumptions are not met, the function may return "Unknown".

Query: What subject is the student writing on the board in the picture?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    board_patches = image_patch.find("board")
    if not board_patches:
        return "No board found in the picture."
    board_patch = board_patches[0]
    writing_patches = board_patch.find("writing")
    if not writing_patches:
        return "No writing found on the board."
    writing_patch = writing_patches[0]
    subject = writing_patch.llm_query("What is the student writing about?")
    return subject
```
This function first finds the board in the image, then finds the writing on the board, and finally uses the `llm_query` method to ask a large language model what the student is writing about. The answer from the language model is returned as the result of the function.

Note that this function assumes that there is only one board and one instance of writing in the image. If there are multiple boards or writings, you may need to modify the function to handle those cases.

Query: What school subject is the student writing on the board in the picture?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    board_patches = image_patch.find("board")
    if not board_patches:
        return "No board found in the picture."
    board_patch = board_patches[0]
    writing_patches = board_patch.find("writing")
    if not writing_patches:
        return "No writing found on the board."
    writing_patch = writing_patches[0]
    subject_query = "What school subject is this writing about?"
    return writing_patch.llm_query(subject_query)
```
Here's how the function works:

1. It creates an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. It finds all patches in the image that match the object "board".
3. If no board is found, it returns a message indicating that.
4. It takes the first board patch and finds all patches within it that match the object "writing".
5. If no writing is found on the board, it returns a message indicating that.
6. It takes the first writing patch and uses the `llm_query` function to ask an external language model what school subject the writing is about.
7. The function returns the answer from the language model.

Note that this function assumes that the image contains a single board with writing on it, and that the writing is related to a specific school subject. If the image contains multiple boards or writing that doesn't match these assumptions, the function may not work as intended.

Query: Decribe what is on the image.


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    objects = []
    
    # Find all objects in the image
    for object_name in ["foo", "bar", "qux", "baz"]:  # add more object names as needed
        patches = image_patch.find(object_name)
        if patches:
            objects.extend([(patch, object_name) for patch in patches])
    
    # Sort objects by their vertical center
    objects.sort(key=lambda x: x[0].vertical_center)
    
    description = ""
    for patch, object_name in objects:
        description += f"There is a {object_name} at ({patch.horizontal_center}, {patch.vertical_center}). "
    
    return description.strip()
```
This function uses the `ImagePatch` class to find all instances of various objects (e.g. "foo", "bar", "qux", "baz") in the image, and then sorts them by their vertical center. It then generates a descriptive string that lists each object and its location on the image.

Note that this function assumes that the `ImagePatch` class has been implemented correctly, and that the `find` method returns a list of `ImagePatch` objects corresponding to the found objects. Also, this function only considers a limited set of object names - you may need to add more object names depending on your specific use case.

Query: How many virtual characters can be seen in the image?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    character_patches = image_patch.find("virtual character")
    return str(len(character_patches))
```
This function finds all patches in the image that match the object "virtual character" and returns the count of those patches as a string.

Note: The `find` method is assumed to return a list of ImagePatch objects, where each object represents a patch in the image that matches the specified object name.

Query: What is the name of the oldest champion in the picture?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    champion_patches = image_patch.find("champion")
    
    # Sort champions by age (assuming "age" property is available)
    champion_patches.sort(key=lambda x: coerce_to_numeric(x.simple_query("What is the age of this champion?")))
    
    oldest_champion_patch = champion_patches[0]
    oldest_champion_name = oldest_champion_patch.simple_query("What is the name of this champion?")
    
    return oldest_champion_name
```
Here's how the function works:

1. Create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. Find all patches in the image that contain a "champion" using the `find` method.
3. Sort the champion patches by age, assuming that each patch has an "age" property that can be queried using the `simple_query` method. The `coerce__to_numeric` function is used to convert the age string to a numeric value.
4. Select the oldest champion patch from the sorted list.
5. Use the `simple_query` method to get the name of the oldest champion from the selected patch.
6. Return the name of the oldest champion.

Note that this function assumes that each champion patch has an "age" property that can be queried using the `simple_query` method. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the function accordingly. Additionally, if there are multiple champions with the same age, this function will return only one of them.

    champion_patches = image_patch.find("League of Legends champion")
    if not champion_patches:
        return "No League of Legends champions found in the picture."
    
    # Sort champions by release date (assuming oldest first)
    champion_patches.sort(key=lambda x: llm_query(f"When was {x.simple_query('What is the name of this champion?')} released?", long_answer=False))
    
    oldest_champion = champion_patches[0]
    return oldest_champion.simple_query("What is the name of this champion?")
```
Here's how the function works:

1. Create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. Find all patches in the image that contain a League of Legends champion using the `find` method.
3. If no champions are found, return a message indicating that no champions were detected.
4. Sort the champion patches by their release date using the `llm_query` function to access external information about each champion's release date. The `simple_query` method is used to get the name of each champion.
5. Return the name of the oldest champion, which is now at index 0 in the sorted list.

Note that this function assumes that the `llm_query` function can access external information about League of Legends champions and their release dates.

Query: In the picture are the League of Legends champions Lux, Jinx, Yasuo and Blitzcrank. Return the ImagePatch and the name of the oldest of these four champions.


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> (ImagePatch, str):
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    lux_patches = image_patch.find("Lux")
    jinx_patches = image_patch.find("Jinx")
    yasuo_patches = image_patch.find("Yasuo")
    blitzcrank_patches = image_patch.find("Blitzcrank")

    if not (lux_patches and jinx_patches and yasuo_patches and blitzcrank_patches):
        return None, "Not all champions found"

    lux_patch = lux_patches[0]
    jinx_patch = jinx_patches[0]
    yasuo_patch = yasuo_patches[0]
    blitzcrank_patch = blitzcrank_patches[0]

    champion_patches = [lux_patch, jinx_patch, yasuo_patch, blitzcrank_patch]

    oldest_champion_name = max(champion_patches, key=lambda x: int(llm_query(f"When was {x.simple_query('What is the name of this champion?')} released?", long_answer=False)))
    oldest_champion_patch = next(patch for patch in champion_patches if patch.simple_query("What is the name of this champion?") == oldest_champion_name)

    return oldest_champion_patch, oldest_champion_name
```
Here's how the function works:

1. It creates an `ImagePatch` object from the input image.
2. It finds all patches corresponding to each of the four champions (Lux, Jinx, Yasuo, and Blitzcrank) using the `find` method.
3. If any of the champions are not found, it returns `None` and a message indicating that not all champions were found.
4. It extracts the first patch for each champion (assuming there's only one instance of each).
5. It uses the `llm_query` function to ask when each champion was released, and stores the results in a list.
6. It finds the oldest champion by taking the maximum value from the list using the `max` function with a lambda function as the key.
7. It returns the patch corresponding to the oldest champion, along with its name.

Note that this implementation assumes that the `llm_query` function can access external information about the release dates of each League of Legends champion.

    else:
        holiday_patch = holiday_patches[0]
        return holiday_patch.llm_query("What is the name of this holiday?")
```
This function first creates an ImagePatch object from the input image. It then uses the `find` method to search for patches in the image that match the object "holiday". If no such patches are found, it returns "Unknown". Otherwise, it takes the first patch and uses the `llm_query` method to ask a large language model (LLM) what the name of the holiday is. The LLM's response is then returned as the answer to the query.

    if not holiday_patches:
        return "Unknown"
    holiday_patch = holiday_patches[0]
    description = holiday_patch.simple_query()
    if "Christian" in description:
        return holiday_patch.llm_query("What is the name of this Christian holiday?")
    else:
        return "Not a Christian holiday"
```
Here's how the function works:

1. Create an ImagePatch object from the input image.
2. Find all patches in the image that match the object "holiday".
3. If no holiday patches are found, return "Unknown".
4. Take the first holiday patch and get its description using the `simple_query` method.
5. Check if the description contains the word "Christian". If it does, use the `llm_query` method to ask a large language model (LLM) what the name of this Christian holiday is.
6. Return the answer from the LLM.

Note that this function assumes that the image contains a depiction of a holiday, and that the description of the holiday patch will contain the word "Christian" if it's a Christian holiday. The `llm_query` method is used to access external information and answer the question about the name of the holiday.

Query: What is the name of the Christian holiday associated with the image?


Code: def execute_command(image, my_fig, time_wait_between_lines, syntax) -> str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    object_patches = image_patch.find("object")
    
    # Assume there's only one relevant object in the image
    object_patch = object_patches[0]
    
    # Ask the LLM about the holiday associated with the object
    holiday_query = f"What is the Christian holiday associated with {object_patch.simple_query('What is this?')}?"
    return image_patch.llm_query(holiday_query)
```
This function first finds an object in the image using the `find` method of the ImagePatch class. It then asks a question to the Large Language Model (LLM) about the Christian holiday associated with that object, using the `llm_query` method. The LLM will provide an answer based on its external knowledge.

Note that this function assumes there is only one relevant object in the image. If there are multiple objects, you may need to modify the function to handle that case.

    if len(jesus_patches) == 0:
        return "No Jesus found in the image"
    jesus_patch = jesus_patches[0]
    holiday_name = jesus_patch.llm_query("What is the Christian holiday associated with this depiction of Jesus?")
    return holiday_name
```
This function first creates an ImagePatch object from the input image. It then finds all patches containing "Jesus" in the image using the `find` method. If no patches are found, it returns a message indicating that no Jesus was found in the image.

If at least one patch is found, it takes the first patch and uses the `llm_query` method to ask an external language model (e.g., GPT-3) what Christian holiday is associated with this depiction of Jesus. The response from the language model is then returned as the answer to the query.
