Query: What color is the shirt of the last child?


Code: # Q: Write a function using Python and the ImagePatch class (above) that could be executed to provide an answer to the query.   Consider the following guidelines: - Use base Python (comparison, sorting) for basic logical operations, left/right/up/down, math, etc. - Use the llm_query function to access external information and answer informational questions not concerning the image.  Query: What color is the shirt of the last child?  

### Hint:
The ImagePatch class has a method called find that returns a list of all patches in the image matching the object name provided as an argument. The ImagePatch class also has methods for verifying properties, finding best text matches, and simple queries.

### Solution:

```python
import math 
class ImagePatch:
    """A Python class containing a crop of an image centered around a particular object, as well as relevant information.
    Attributes
    ----------
    cropped_image : array_like
        An array-like of the cropped image taken from the original image.
    left, lower, right, upper : int
        An int describing the position of the (left/lower/right/upper) border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
     Methods
    -------
    find(object_name: str)->List[ImagePatch]
        Returns a list of new ImagePatch objects containing crops of the image centered around any objects found in the
        image matching the object_name.
    exists(object_name: str)->bool
        Returns True if the object specified by object_name is found in the image, and False otherwise.
    verify_property(property: str)->bool
        Returns True if the property is met, and False otherwise.
    best_text_match(option_list: List[str], prefix: str)->str
        Returns the string that best matches the image.
    simple_query(question: str=None)->str
        Returns the answer to a basic question asked about the image. If no question is provided, returns the answer to "What is this?".
